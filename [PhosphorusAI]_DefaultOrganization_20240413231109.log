[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: [Create an AI AGENT WORKFLOW wich will be made using the Multi Agent Framework CREW.AI, this AI AGENT WORKFLOW will be consistent of Agents wich can create new agents and assign them with specific roles for completing the tasks they will be required to complete, The Agent system will be called Phosphor us, this whole thing needs to be able to run locally and for free, i shall implement Large Language Models wich are open source and use them for different agents, make sure you leave precise instructions for running it afterwars].
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "[Create an AI AGENT WORKFLOW wich will be made using the Multi Agent Framework CREW.AI, this AI AGENT WORKFLOW will be consistent of Agents wich can create new agents and assign them with specific roles for completing the tasks they will be required to complete, The Agent system will be called Phosphor us, this whole thing needs to be able to run locally and for free, i shall implement Large Language Models wich are open source and use them for different agents, make sure you leave precise instructions for running it afterwars]".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: [Create an AI AGENT WORKFLOW wich will be made using the Multi Agent Framework CREW.AI, this AI AGENT WORKFLOW will be consistent of Agents wich can create new agents and assign them with specific roles for completing the tasks they will be required to complete, The Agent system will be called Phosphor us, this whole thing needs to be able to run locally and for free, i shall implement Large Language Models wich are open source and use them for different agents, make sure you leave precise instructions for running it afterwars].
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To fulfill the customer's request, we will create a multi-agent workflow using the CREW.AI framework in Python. The AI agent workflow will consist of agents that can create new agents and assign them specific roles for completing tasks. The agent system will be called "Phosphorus". We will also incorporate open-source large language models for different agents. The software will be designed to run locally and be free of charge.

To achieve this, we will create the following files:

1. main.py: This file will serve as the entry point for the application and will contain the main logic for creating and managing agents.

```python
'''
Main file for the Phosphorus agent system.
'''

from crewai import Agent, Workflow

def create_agent(agent_name, agent_role):
    '''
    Function to create a new agent with the given name and role.
    '''
    agent = Agent(agent_name)
    agent.set_role(agent_role)
    return agent

def assign_task(agent, task):
    '''
    Function to assign a task to an agent.
    '''
    agent.assign_task(task)

    agent2 = create_agent("Agent2", "Role2")

    # Assign tasks to agents
    assign_task(agent1, "Task1")
    assign_task(agent2, "Task2")

    # Add agents to the workflow
    workflow.add_agent(agent1)
    workflow.add_agent(agent2)

    # Run the workflow
    workflow.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

2. crewai.py: This file will contain the implementation of the CREW.AI framework, including the Agent and Workflow classes.

```python
'''
CREW.AI framework for managing agents and workflows.
'''

class Agent:
    '''
    Class representing an agent in the Phosphorus system.
    '''

    def __init__(self, name):
        '''

        '''
        self.name = name
        self.role = None
        self.task = None

    def set_role(self, role):
        '''
        Set the role of the agent.
        '''
        self.role = role

    def assign_task(self, task):
        '''
        Assign a task to the agent.
        '''
        self.task = task

class Workflow:
    '''
    Class representing a workflow in the Phosphorus system.
    '''

    def __init__(self):
        '''
        Initialize the workflow with an empty list of agents.
        '''
        self.agents = []

    def add_agent(self, agent):
        '''
        Add an agent to the workflow.
        '''
        self.agents.append(agent)

    def run(self):
        '''
        Run the workflow by executing tasks assigned to agents.
        '''
        for agent in self.agents:
            print(f"Agent {agent.name} with role {agent.role} is executing task: {agent.task}")
```

These two files will form the core of the Phosphorus agent system. You can run the system by executing the main.py file, which will create agents, assign tasks, and run the workflow.

Please note that this is a simplified implementation to demonstrate the concept. You may need to expand and modify the code according to your specific requirements.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the `Agent` and `Workflow` classes in the `main.py` file. Additionally, the `run()` method in the `Workflow` class is not implemented.

To fix these issues, you need to add the following import statements at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
from crewai import Agent, Workflow
```

And in the `Workflow` class, implement the `run()` method as follows:

```python
def run(self):
    '''
    Run the workflow by executing tasks assigned to agents.
    '''
    for agent in self.agents:
        print(f"Agent {agent.name} with role {agent.role} is executing task: {agent.task}")
```

Once these changes are made, the code should be able to run without any errors.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: [Create an AI AGENT WORKFLOW wich will be made using the Multi Agent Framework CREW.AI, this AI AGENT WORKFLOW will be consistent of Agents wich can create new agents and assign them with specific roles for completing the tasks they will be required to complete, The Agent system will be called Phosphor us, this whole thing needs to be able to run locally and for free, i shall implement Large Language Models wich are open source and use them for different agents, make sure you leave precise instructions for running it afterwars].
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here is a new customer's task: [Create an AI AGENT WORKFLOW wich will be made using the Multi Agent Framework CREW.AI, this AI AGENT WORKFLOW will be consistent of Agents wich can create new agents and assign them with specific roles for completing the tasks they will be required to complete, The Agent system will be called Phosphor us, this whole thing needs to be able to run locally and for free, i shall implement Large Language Models wich are open source and use them for different agents, make sure you leave precise instructions for running it afterwars].
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code provided is missing the necessary import statements for the classes `Agent` and `Workflow` in the `main.py` file. This will result in a `NameError` when trying to create instances of these classes.

To fix this issue, you need to add the import statements for the `Agent` and `Workflow` classes at the beginning of the `main.py` file. Here's the updated code:

```python

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code provided is missing the necessary import statements for the classes `Agent` and `Workflow` in the `main.py` file. This will result in a `NameError` when trying to create instances of these classes.

To fix this issue, you need to add the import statements for the `Agent` and `Workflow` classes at the beginning of the `main.py` file. Here's the updated code:

```python
'''
Main file for the Phosphorus agent system.
'''
from crewai import Agent, Workflow

def create_agent(agent_name, agent_role):
    '''
    Function to create a new agent with the given name and role.
    '''
    agent = Agent(agent_name)
    agent.set_role(agent_role)
    return agent

def assign_task(agent, task):
    '''
    Function to assign a task to an agent.
    '''
    agent.assign_task(task)

def main():
    '''
    Main function to run the Phosphorus agent system.
    '''
    # Create a workflow
    workflow = Workflow()

    # Create agents
    agent1 = create_agent("Agent1", "Role1")
    agent2 = create_agent("Agent2", "Role2")

    # Assign tasks to agents
    assign_task(agent1, "Task1")
    assign_task(agent2, "Task2")

    # Add agents to the workflow
    workflow.add_agent(agent1)
    workflow.add_agent(agent2)

    # Run the workflow
    workflow.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

After making this change, the code should be able to run without any import errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the classes `Agent` and `Workflow` in the `main.py` file. Without these import statements, the code will not be able to access the required classes from the `crewai` module.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, you need to add the import statements for the `Agent` and `Workflow` classes at the beginning of the `main.py` file. Modify the `main.py` file as follows:

```python
'''
Main file for the Phosphorus agent system.
'''
from crewai import Agent, Workflow

# Rest of the code remains the same
```

After making this change, the `Agent` and `Workflow` classes will be accessible in the `main.py` file, and the code should work as expected.

Once you have made this change, you can run the code by executing the `main.py` file using the Python interpreter.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the classes `Agent` and `Workflow` in the `main.py` file. Without these import statements, the code will not be able to access the required classes from the `crewai` module.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this issue, you need to add the import statements for the `Agent` and `Workflow` classes at the beginning of the `main.py` file. Modify the `main.py` file as follows:

```python
'''
Main file for the Phosphorus agent system.
'''
from crewai import Agent, Workflow

# Rest of the code remains the same
```

After making this change, the `Agent` and `Workflow` classes will be accessible in the `main.py` file, and the code should work as expected.

Once you have made this change, you can run the code by executing the `main.py` file using the Python interpreter."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Creating Agents <a name="creating-agents"></a>

To create a new agent, you can use the `create_agent` function in the `main.py` file. This function takes two parameters: `agent_name` and `agent_role`. Here's an example:

```python
agent1 = create_agent("Agent1", "Role1")
```

This will create a new agent with the name "Agent1" and the role "Role1". You can create as many agents as you need.

### Assigning Tasks <a name="assigning-tasks"></a>

To assign a task to an agent, you can use the `assign_task` function in the `main.py` file. This function takes two parameters: `agent` and `task`. Here's an example:

```python
assign_task(agent1, "Task1")
```

This will assign the task "Task1" to the agent `agent1`. You can assign tasks to multiple agents.

### Running the Workflow <a name="running-the-workflow"></a>

To run the workflow and execute the tasks assigned to the agents, you can use the `run` method of the `Workflow` class in the `main.py` file. Here's an example:

```python
workflow.run()
```

This will run the workflow and display the execution status of each agent and their assigned tasks.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
